## Bank Classifier
This aims to take in any bank data (although it has only been tested with ING bank data) and classify it. It takes in labelled data, which trains a classifier that can predict categories based on the description.

## Build status
It now includes different vectorisers (count and tfidf) although they seem to perform about the same (count is maybe slightly better).
I haven't explored any hyperparamater optimisation with this project but it is defintiely an area I need to explore more.
I could also and see if I can explore more ML models (eg Linear SVC) but I'm pretty happy on where it is at.

## Improvements
Generally keen for improvements if people want to suggest them though as this is my first go at building a class in Python and I haven't done much else in ML generally.

Thanks,
Ryan
