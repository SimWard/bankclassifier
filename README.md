## Bank Classifier
This aims to take in any bank data (although it has only been tested with ING bank data) and classify it. It takes in labelled data, which trains a classifier that can predict categories based on the description.

## Motivation
The aim here was to really expand my machine learning skills, but also play around with the class object as I haven't used it much before and this seemed to be a good opportunity.

## Build status
Still need to commit the relevant CSVs when I've cleaned them of personal information. This makes this not so useful until I do that...

Thanks,
Ryan
